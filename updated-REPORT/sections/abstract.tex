\section*{Abstract} %

The pipe-less plant at the Process Dynamics and Operations group is an experimental setup of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) moving between various stations. The AGVs dynamically change trajectories in an operational mode based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme with the objective to get from one station to the other while at the same time avoiding each other. The current positioning system is based on pattern recognition where the system tracks each AGV based on a unique pattern of LEDs via a camera that overlooks the plant. The vision-based positioning system displays some flaws and should be replaced by a system more adapted to the actual operational environment of the experimental plant. \\

The project aimed at first evaluating different potential positioning systems, selecting one of them based on defined metrics and then to develop a proof-of-concept based on the chosen technology for the experimental pipe-less production plant in a model-driven fashion and the 
Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) was chosen for further evaluation and implementation.
The system uses RFID tags are embedded with a transmitter and a receiver. When the tags are within the range of the reader, the reader receives the unique ID and the RSSI (Received signal strength indication) of the tag which is being used for calculating the position of the robot. \\

For the estimation part, the WiFi module then transmits the reader data through the local network, using TCP/IP communication. The system data is lastly received by a PC that represents the control hub of the plant through a framework implemented in C Sharp (\texttt{C\#}). The algorithm calculating AGV position prompts for this data as position and/or orientation of an AGV needs to be computed.
